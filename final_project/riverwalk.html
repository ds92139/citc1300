                    <h2>about the riverwalk</h2>
                    <p>The riverwalk is just ahead of the OMNI/Branch Center building. It can also be accessed by the
                        CETAS building too. You'll see it past all the picnic tables and trees. The riverwalk actually extends
                        all the way out to Chattanooga, making it walkable all the way down to the city. Since it's very close to
                        the OMNI building, I've gone down there a few times before. There's a gate too on the path that I believe
                        gets closed at a certain late time.

                    <h3>tennessee riverpark</h3>
                    <p>
                        Down the riverwalk, especially by the lake, is also sometimes called the Tennessee Riverpark. If you keep
                        going further down, past the bridge with the railroad on top, you'll get to what I think is the main part.
                        A lot of people walk this path, and the area around here is especially popular for people fishing. Some fish
                        at a lower elevation on the rocks, but I've seen others do it right by the dam. It's definitely recognized as popular
                        since there are some signs about the riverwalk as well placed. Sometimes I wonder how many students know about this area,
                        since I only learned about it in recent months.
