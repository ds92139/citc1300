                <h2>The Library</h2>
                <p>The library is definitely the quietest place on campus. It's good for studying here with the way it's set 
                    up as well. I like how the tables with multiple seats are all separated between each other so you can
                    concentrate on your own work without being distracted that someone is sitting near you. There's even
                    outlets to charge your computer if you have the cable. I think most people try to sit as far away from each other as they can anyway. 
                    It doesn't seem to get crowded much here, but I don't go here often anyway, so I'm not sure.
                </p>

                <h2>Parts I Haven't Seen</h2>
                <p>I've never bothered to really walk through the whole building personally. So I've never actually been to
                     the back of the library(2nd photo pointed in that direction). When I glanced, the first thing I noticed
                     was what looked like study rooms. I was wondering who uses them exactly, and I think it's most likely students.
                    I've been tutored before and it never takes place there, and instead in different rooms. Maybe it's where some
                     may meet for group projects or one person just studying alone.
                </p>
