            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Chatt State's not a very big campus, but there's 
                still many things to notice about it. Some areas are listed in the list below,
                 with more explanation on the other page. The pond near the front of the campus 
                 is where most of the geese around campus center around. There also used to be a 
                 bridge there across the water, but I don't know why it was taken away. I also sometimes wonder
                 why the geese are on campus in the first place. I thought maybe they were placed there one day,
                 I can't imagine they would just wander here and stay.

            <h3>The Branch Center</h3>
            <p>
                Most of the activity on campus takes place in bigger buildings like OMNI or Tcat. There are some smaller
                buildings I've seen, but I'll talk about one of them here. The Branch Center is pretty close to OMNI, 
                but is a lot less smaller. You could walk the whole building within two minutes I'd say. I think it's a nice 
                place to study though. There's even a small lounge area near the back that's used quite a lot.
